Step 1: normalize
It regulates the data inequality according to the digits in the label in the original dataset and creates new labels.

The codes in the command sections make the same counter change.

Step 2: Cut
It cuts and classifies the digits based on the height values ​​according to the original images and labels.

Step 3: change between counters
It compares the original labels with the new labels, for the changed digits and for the digit that needs to be changed from the classified folder made in the cut step, the appropriate digit (height and width values ​​are checked) is selected and pasted to that section. If the appropriate digit is not found, the cropping process is performed.
